description: When and how to add or update AGENTS.md for agent-facing documentation
alwaysApply: true

# AGENTS.md

**AGENTS.md** at the repo root gives AI agents (e.g. Cursor, Codex) persistent instructions for this project.

## When to update

- You add or change **agent-facing behavior** (new conventions, workflows, or entrypoints).
- You introduce **new patterns** that agents should follow (e.g. new skills, install steps, doc locations).
- You want agents to **prefer or avoid** certain files, tools, or approaches.

## When to create

If **AGENTS.md** does not exist and you are:
- Adding documented workflows that agents should use, or
- Defining project-specific rules that belong in one place,

then **create** `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.

## What to include

- **Brief project context** so agents understand the repo’s purpose.
- **Conventions** (e.g. doc format, test/install steps, key paths).
- **Pointers** to other docs (e.g. CONTRIBUTING.md, skills in `.cursor/skills/`).
- **Actionable instructions** (do X when Y; prefer Z; avoid W).

Keep it short and scannable; link to full docs instead of duplicating them.

## Example snippet

```markdown
# RLinf – Agent instructions

- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md for PRs, lint, and tests.
- New embodied envs/models: see .cursor/skills/add-install-docker-ci-e2e and add-example-doc-model-env.
- Prefer existing skills in .cursor/skills/ before adding new workflows.
```
