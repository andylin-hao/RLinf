"""Supported robots: one module each, holding its config and robot class.

Each robot class owns its own construction: ``build()`` composes deferred part
declarations, and ``register_type()`` wires the class and its config into the
registry while supplying the standard discovery flow. ``Robot.connect()``
performs placement later. Importing this package performs those registrations.
