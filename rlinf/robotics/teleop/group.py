"""Several devices, each driving a named part of one action.

A dexterous-hand setup is a spacemouse on the arm and a glove on the hand. A
dual-arm GELLO setup is one leader per side. Each of those used to be a class
that read its devices and spliced their outputs together by hand; here they are
the same object with a different list.

:class:`TeleopGroup` is the teleop counterpart of
:class:`~rlinf.robotics.parts.base.Group`: it fans out over what it holds and
merges the results by name.
