"""What a device means for the robot it drives, and how devices compose.

A device reports what the operator did; a :class:`TeleopBinding` says which
parts of the action that fills; :class:`TeleopGroup` merges several of them
into one action. Composing here is what removes the hand-written classes that
used to splice a spacemouse and a glove, or two leader arms, together.
