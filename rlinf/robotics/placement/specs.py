"""Declaring a part and where it runs, without building it yet.

A part whose vendor SDK only exists on one machine cannot be constructed here
and moved there. So placement takes a *declaration* -- a class, its constructor
arguments, and a ``node_rank`` -- and builds the part on the target node.

``RobotPart.at(...)`` produces a :class:`PartSpec`. Compose specs exactly where
you would compose parts; :meth:`Robot.connect` resolves them. Nobody writes a
placement call.

    robot = FrankaRobot(
        arms={"left": Arm(FrankaROSArm.at("10.0.0.1", node_rank=1))},
        cameras={"scene": RealSenseCamera.at(info, node_rank=2)},
    )
    robot.connect()

One spec is placed once, however many times it is referenced, so a driver whose
single connection backs several components is not opened twice.
