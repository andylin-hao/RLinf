"""Placing a part on a node, and reaching it once it is there.

Any :class:`~rlinf.robotics.parts.base.RobotPart` can be hosted in a scheduler
worker: an arm on the machine wired to it, a camera on the machine it is
plugged into. :meth:`Connection.place` is the entry point; everything here is
what it returns.

There is no per-hardware worker class. For any part, :func:`part_worker_cls`
synthesizes ``type(name, (Worker, PartCls), ...)`` once and caches it.
``WorkerGroup`` then binds every public method of that class as an RPC, so a
hosted part exposes its whole surface -- the subpart-addressed calls *and*
hardware methods like ``is_robot_up`` or ``reset_joint`` -- with no delegation
written by hand.

A handle answers two questions the same way whether the part runs here or in a
worker: *what subparts does it expose*, and *how do I call a method that is not
on the part interface*. Off-interface calls always return a result object with
``wait() -> list``, so call sites read identically::

    handle.is_robot_up().wait()[0]

This is the only module in ``rlinf.robotics`` that imports the scheduler.
``Connection.place`` imports it lazily, so importing a part never loads Ray.
