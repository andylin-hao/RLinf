"""Declaring where a part runs, and running it there.

A part whose vendor SDK only exists on one machine cannot be built here and
moved. So placement takes a declaration -- a class, its constructor arguments,
and a node -- and builds the part on that node, handing back a handle that
behaves the same whether the part ended up local or remote.

:mod:`.specs` is the declaring half and imports nothing from the scheduler.
:mod:`.handles` is the running half, and is the one module in
``rlinf.robotics`` allowed to import it.
