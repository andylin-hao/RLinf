r"""Robot parts: what a component *is* to the policy.

The taxonomy lives in :mod:`.base`; each category's implementations live in the
subpackage named after it::

    parts/
      base.py                     Endpoint, RobotPart, Connection,
                                  ControllablePart, Group, Camera,
                                  EndEffector, MobileBase, LeggedBase
      arms/                       Franky, Franka ROS, GimArm, Turtle2, DOSW1
      cameras/                    RealSense, ZED, Lumos
      end_effectors/
        grippers/                 Franka, Robotiq
        hands/                    Ruiyan
      transports/                 ROS

A part says what a component means to the policy: its observation and action
contract. A link that presents several components at once -- a dual-arm
controller, a two-armed SDK session -- is a :class:`~.base.Connection` rather
than a part: it lists what rides on it in :meth:`~.base.Endpoint.parts`, and
the robot composes those. Both are :class:`~.base.Endpoint`\ s, so both are
declared, placed, opened and closed the same way.

Subpackages are not imported here: a node needs only the vendor SDKs for the
hardware it actually has. Import ``rlinf.robotics.parts.cameras`` directly.
