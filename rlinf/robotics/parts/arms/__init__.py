"""Arms, and the hardware sessions behind them.

Each module owns one vendor connection and the parts it exposes through
:attr:`~rlinf.robotics.parts.base.Connection.parts` -- typically the arm
itself plus its end effector, and for coupled hardware several arms at once.

Symbols load lazily so a node without a given vendor SDK can still import this
package.
