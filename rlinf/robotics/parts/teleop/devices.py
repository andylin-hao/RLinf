"""The devices an operator drives, as parts.

Each class here wraps one vendor reader from :mod:`.readers` and presents it the
way every other part is presented: connect, report an observation, disconnect.
The observation is whatever the operator did, in the device's own terms -- a
twist, a set of joint angles, a grip. Turning that into a command for a robot is
the job of a binding, in :mod:`rlinf.robotics.teleop`.

Opening the hardware happens in ``connect`` rather than ``__init__``, so a device
can be declared on one machine and built on another with
``SpaceMouse.at(node_rank=1)``.
