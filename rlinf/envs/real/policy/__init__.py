"""What the policy sends and reads, declared in one place.

A robot preset builds an :class:`ActionLayout` and an :class:`ObservationSpec`.
Together they are the contract a checkpoint is trained against: the channels
of its action, the keys of its observation, the order they flatten in, and the
colour order of its frames.
