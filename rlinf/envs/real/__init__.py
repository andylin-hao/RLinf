"""Real-world environments, and the tasks each robot can be asked to do.

Names load on first use rather than at import. Pulling in every robot means
Gymnasium, OpenCV, SciPy, and the model stack, which a bench script driving one
teleop device over a serial port has no need for -- and a machine holding only
that device may not even have installed. Touching any name here loads
everything and registers every task, so ``from rlinf.envs.real import
RealWorldEnv`` behaves exactly as it did.
