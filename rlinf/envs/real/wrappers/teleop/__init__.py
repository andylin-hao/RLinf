"""Letting an operator take over, on the environment's terms.

What the operator is asking for is worked out in
:mod:`rlinf.robotics.teleop`: devices report, bindings say what a reading means
for the robot, and a group merges them. Everything here is what that cannot
answer on its own, because it depends on the environment.

:class:`TeleopIntervention` decides when the operator's action replaces the
policy's and records that it did. :class:`ComposedTeleop` flattens a group's
named parts into this env's action vector, using the layout from
:mod:`.layout`. :mod:`.config` resolves which devices a config asked for,
:mod:`.backends` says what each of those names is, and :mod:`.builder` puts
them together in the right order.
