"""Presenting a composed teleop group as one device to the env.

:class:`~rlinf.robotics.teleop.group.TeleopGroup` produces action *parts*, named
after what they drive. An env takes one flat vector. This is the only place that
knows how to get from one to the other, and it is the only piece of the teleop
story that has to be on the env side at all.

The layout comes from the env, which built the action space in the first place.
