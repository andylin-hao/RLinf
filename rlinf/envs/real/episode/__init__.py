"""Wrappers that let an operator drive the episode rather than the robot.

None of these touch the action. They decide when an episode starts, when it ends,
what reward it earned, and which policy is in charge -- the judgements a person
watching the robot makes, which no sensor reports. Teleop is the other half of
that story and lives in :mod:`rlinf.envs.real.teleop`.
