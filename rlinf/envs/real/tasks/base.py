"""A real-world task: what counts as doing the job, on whatever robot does it.

A task states what it needs from the robot, puts the scene back between
episodes, and scores each step. It never builds an action: how a policy's
action reaches the arm belongs to the :class:`~rlinf.envs.real.control.Control`
the env is driven with, so one task runs under joint and Cartesian control
alike.
