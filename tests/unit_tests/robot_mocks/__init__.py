"""Vendor SDKs, faked, so a real part can be run without its hardware.

Every part imports its SDK inside ``_open`` or ``connect`` rather than at module
scope. Putting a fake in :data:`sys.modules` first is therefore enough for the
part's own code -- its lifecycle, its state conversion, its action dispatch --
to run unchanged against something that answers. Nothing about the part is
stubbed; only what is on the other end of the cable.

That is the difference from a test double: a double proves the code around the
part is right, and this proves the part is.

Use it as a context manager::

    from robot_mocks import mocked_sdks

    with mocked_sdks():
        robot = build_robot("DualFranka", left_robot_ip="1.2.3.4", ...)
        robot.connect()

The bench check takes ``--mock`` and does exactly this, so the same command
that verifies a real robot also runs in CI.
