New Real-World Tasks
====================

Use this guide when RLinf already knows how to connect the physical robot and
your change is about what it should accomplish. By the end, you will have a
config dataclass, a small env class, a registered Gymnasium ID, and a YAML config
you can launch.

This guide covers task modules under ``rlinf/envs/real``. To add a task to a
simulator or benchmark, follow :doc:`new_env` instead.

You will not change robot construction, device placement, or teleoperation.
Targets, compliance settings, success rules, and reset behavior belong to the
task; the existing robot and wrapper stack remain in place. If the hardware
itself is new, follow :doc:`new_robot` first and return here once one observation
and action can pass through it.

Steps
-----

The examples below add a ``WipeEnv-v1`` task to the existing Franka support.
Follow them in order: later steps refer to the config class and Gymnasium ID
chosen earlier.

For a joint-space arm, use the same sequence with its existing env base.
``SO101ReachEnv-v1`` and ``examples/embodiment/config/env/so101_reach.yaml`` are
the current references for five absolute joint targets plus one continuous
gripper action. The robot still exposes the gripper at
``arm.end_effector``; the env is responsible for presenting the flat six-value
action expected by its policy.

1. Write the config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create ``rlinf/envs/real/<robot>/<task>.py`` beside the other tasks for that
robot. Inherit its config dataclass and add the fields required by your task:

.. code-block:: python

   from dataclasses import dataclass, field

   import numpy as np

   from .base import FrankaEnv, FrankaRobotConfig, compliance


   @dataclass
   class WipeConfig(FrankaRobotConfig):
       task_description: str = "wipe the surface"
       target_ee_pose: np.ndarray = field(default_factory=lambda: np.zeros(6))
       reward_threshold: np.ndarray = field(
           default_factory=lambda: np.array([0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2])
       )
       random_xy_range: float = 0.03

       def __post_init__(self):
           self.compliance_param = compliance(
               translational_stiffness=800,   # softer, to keep contact
               translational_clip_z=0.02,
           )
           self.target_ee_pose = np.array(self.target_ee_pose)
           self.action_scale = np.array([0.02, 0.1, 1])

State only the gains that differ. ``compliance()`` merges them onto
``COMPLIANCE_DEFAULTS`` and raises on any gain the controller does not accept. A
misspelled gain stops here instead of reaching the impedance controller and
being ignored.

2. Write the env
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the env class's config type. For many tasks, that is the whole class:

.. code-block:: python

   class WipeEnv(FrankaEnv):
       CONFIG_CLS = WipeConfig

Override a hook only when the task needs different behavior. ``go_to_rest`` is
the common case because homing depends on the task's end pose. Peg insertion,
for example, lifts clear of the slot first; otherwise the peg catches on the way
up:

.. code-block:: python

       def go_to_rest(self, joint_reset=False):
           reset_pose = copy.deepcopy(self._franka_state.tcp_pose)
           reset_pose[2] += 0.05
           self._interpolate_move(reset_pose, timeout=1)
           super().go_to_rest(joint_reset)

A task that keeps its robot's action space inherits how that action is read. A
task that changes the action space declares the change, because a teleop device
is matched against what each part means rather than how wide it is:

.. code-block:: python

       def action_parts(self):
           return (
               ActionPart("arm", 6, ActionKind.CARTESIAN_DELTA),
               ActionPart("end_effector", 1, ActionKind.GRIPPER),
           )

The declared widths must add up to the action space exactly; a mismatch is an
error rather than a slice that lands somewhere unintended.

3. Register it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add one entry to the robot's ``TASKS`` table in
``rlinf/envs/real/<robot>/__init__.py``, naming the env class:

.. code-block:: python

   from .wipe import WipeEnv

   TASKS = {
       ...
       "WipeEnv-v1": WipeEnv,
   }

``register_tasks`` builds the entry point and registers the id with Gymnasium.
The wrapper stack does not appear here: the env declared it above, and
``build_stack`` reads that declaration.

User configs and dataset metadata store the gym id. Changing it later breaks
those references. Choose the name before collecting data.

4. Add the env config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a YAML file under ``examples/embodiment/config/env/``. Keep the registered
id at the path shown below and describe the task fields in ``override_cfg``;
these fields come from your config dataclass:

.. code-block:: yaml

   env_type: real
   init_params:
     id: "WipeEnv-v1"      # the gym id you registered
     num_envs: null
   teleop: spacemouse
   override_cfg:
     target_ee_pose: [0.5, 0.0, 0.1, -3.14, 0.0, 0.0]
     random_xy_range: 0.03

5. Check it
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before connecting hardware, confirm that the id is registered and its entry
point resolves:

.. code-block:: python

   from rlinf.envs.real import RealWorldEnv  # registers every task
   from gymnasium.envs.registration import registry

   assert "WipeEnv-v1" in registry

``tests/unit_tests/test_real_env.py`` makes the same assertion for every shipped
task. Add your id to ``EXPECTED_IDS`` there.

What You Do Not Need to Write
-----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Concern
     - Where it already lives
   * - Connecting and placing hardware
     - ``Robot.connect``; see :doc:`../concepts/robotics`.
   * - Teleoperation
     - ``teleop`` in the env config selects one; the wrapper stack builds
       it.
   * - Marking reward or ending an episode by hand
     - ``keyboard_reward_wrapper`` in the env config.
   * - Relative frames, Euler conversion, gripper narrowing
     - ``real/wrappers/transforms/``, applied by the wrapper stack.
   * - Impedance gains that every task shares
     - ``COMPLIANCE_DEFAULTS``; state only your deltas.

Adding a Teleop Device
----------------------

A teleop device is one class in one module under
``rlinf/robotics/parts/teleop/``. It answers three questions: how to reach the
hardware, what the operator is doing, and what the robot should do about it.

.. code-block:: python

   @TeleopDevice.register("pedal")
   class Pedal(TeleopDevice):
       PRODUCES = {"end_effector": ActionKind.GRIPPER}

       def __init__(self, port: str) -> None:
           self._port = port

       def _open(self):
           from example_pedal_sdk import PedalClient

           return PedalClient(port=self._port)

       def _release(self, device) -> None:
           device.close()

       @property
       def observation_features(self):
           return {"pressed": {"shape": (1,), "dtype": "bool"}}

       def get_observation(self):
           return {"pressed": np.asarray([self._device.is_pressed()])}

       def action(self, reading, context):
           pressed = bool(reading["pressed"][0])
           return TeleopAction(
               parts={"end_effector": np.array([-1.0 if pressed else 1.0])},
               driving=pressed,
           )

``_open`` reaches the hardware when the device connects and returns whatever
speaks to it; that handle is ``self._device``. ``_release`` closes the same
handle during rollback, normal shutdown, and reconnect. ``__init__`` only
records the declaration, because declaration and connection may happen on
different machines. If a reader owns a polling thread, stop and join that
thread before returning from ``_release``.

``PRODUCES`` maps each action part the device fills to what its numbers *mean*,
so a device offering a twist to a joint-space arm is refused rather than
obeyed. ``action`` answers everything about one reading at once, as a
``TeleopAction``. ``driving`` is part of that one answer rather than a second
call: a device whose answer depends on state it just computed would otherwise
have to leave that state behind, and nothing would enforce the order of the two
calls.

The name in ``register`` is the one the env config spells. Config becomes
constructor arguments through ``from_config``, which by default passes the
device's own options straight through, so the example above needs none. Override
it to read a key from the wider env config, or to choose behaviour from the
robot being driven:

.. code-block:: python

   @classmethod
   def from_config(cls, cfg, options, facts):
       port = options.get("port") or cfg.get("pedal_port")
       if port is None:
           raise ValueError("teleop device 'pedal' requires a port")
       return TeleopEntry(cls(port=port), drives=options.get("drives"))

Finally add ``pedal`` to the environment's ``TELEOP`` tuple, which declares that
the env can represent the device's action. That does not register it a second
time: the shared builder resolves the name through ``TeleopDevice``. A robot
without an ``end_effector`` rejects the rig at build time.

A device that needs a second mapping of the same hardware -- joint targets
rather than Cartesian ones, say -- subclasses the first and overrides
``action``, as ``GelloJoint`` does with ``Gello``.

Adding a Wrapper Instead
------------------------

When the new behavior surrounds a rollout, add a wrapper. Put action replacement
in ``teleop/`` and representation changes in ``transforms/``;
rollout boundaries and scores belong in ``episode/``. A new teleop device is one
device class, as above, not a wrapper. For a new keyboard mode, subclass
``KeyboardSession``.
:doc:`../concepts/realworld_envs` describes both extension points.
